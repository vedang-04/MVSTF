# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
This was a project created as a solution to the PS provided by TATA InfoCom. for the ML Hackathon conducted by Techfest, IIT B. 
It is inspired by the concept of Multivariate time series forecasting wherein multiple variables will be varying over time. 
Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has some dependency on other variables.

The given dataset consisted of 3915 regions and their business potential for the past 6 years (1-72 months). 
I was expected to build a projection of the business potential for each of the 3915 regions for the next 12 to 15 months (72-87 months). 
I provided the solution by using models using the other correlated time series. The results can be seen below. 
Here the classical ML models are used along with sequential Neural Networks and Statistical Time Series Models which forecast both univariate and multivariate timeseries.
